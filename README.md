Database Project: Company Management Stored Procedures

Overview As part of a database project, I developed a set of stored procedures to facilitate easy access to important information for the company's manager. 
The stored procedures retrieve valuable insights from the company's sales data during different time periods.

Business Impact
The stored procedures empower the manager to quickly analyze staff performance and identify top customers within specific time frames. 
This timely access to critical data aids in strategic decision-making and enhances overall business efficiency.
